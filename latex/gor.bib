Nagel (1995), which they refer to as the 'beauty contest' game following J. M. Keynes (1936). In these games, groups of subjects are repeatedly asked to simultaneously guess a real number in the interval [0, 100] that they believe will be closest to 1/2 times either the median, mean, or maximum of all numbers chosen. The authors also use their experimental data to test a simple model of adaptive learning behavior. Copyright 1997 by Royal Economic Society.},
